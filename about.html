		<h3><strong><font color="grey">SHORT STORY LONG.</font></strong> I was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Came to the states when I was 19 years old, did my undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering, and now I have one more year left for my masters in Mechanical Engineering. Co-founded an engineering software company <a target=_blank href="http://www.durabilika.com"><img src="images/logo.png"></a>with my professor. Wanted to learn more about the programming aspect of things, so here am I, at Grand Circus, coding away! Creating my first portfolio <img src="images/smiley.jpg"></h3>
